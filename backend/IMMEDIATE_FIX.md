# Immediate Fix for Image Upload Issue

## ðŸš¨ **Current Problem**
Images uploaded to Strapi are not showing because Cloudinary credentials are not configured.

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Use Local Storage (Immediate Fix)**
The code is now configured to fall back to local storage if Cloudinary credentials aren't set. This will work immediately but files will still be lost on Render restarts.

### **Option 2: Set Up Cloudinary (Recommended)**
For persistent file storage:

1. **Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)**
2. **Sign up for free account**
3. **Get your credentials from dashboard**
4. **Add to Render Environment Variables:**
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
5. **Deploy**

### **Option 3: Use AWS S3 (Alternative)**
If you prefer AWS S3:
1. Install: `npm install @strapi/provider-upload-aws-s3`
2. Configure with AWS credentials
3. Add environment variables for AWS

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Action**
Deploy the current changes - images should work with local storage for now, then set up Cloudinary for persistence.
